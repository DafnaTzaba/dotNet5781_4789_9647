# Transportation management system

A .Net and C# based program for managing the public transportation system. 
This project included a Windows based GUI implementation for both the server and client.

This project uses the three-layer model in order to create a good and correct separation between the data layer and the display layer.
In the program you can plan your trip, see bus rou and see a real-time simulation at a particular station by building threds.
